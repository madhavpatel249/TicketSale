# Evently

Evently is a practice project inspired by Ticketmaster, built to strengthen my skills with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). It simulates a real-world ticket-selling platform where users can browse, create, and buy tickets for events. This project helped me gain hands-on experience with full-stack development, authentication, and deployment. While it's my first full-stack app, it includes key features like filtering, role-based access, and a mock checkout flow.

 **Live Demo:** [ticketsale-xi.vercel.app](https://ticketsale-xi.vercel.app/)
